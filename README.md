# Simple Note App

This project is hosted at [https://thawing-sea-27868.herokuapp.com/](https://thawing-sea-27868.herokuapp.com/). Please be patient while it fires up for the first time. On the initial load, a few default placeholder notes are displayed while the api supporting the note app boots up. Refresh after about 30 seconds to see a message about no notes! Add/Edit/Remove/Search away!
